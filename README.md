This Python 3 notebook includes all functions and modules requried to run the quote embedding algorithm. 
Use it for your own projects at will. 

Tensorflow , tf-hub and tf-sentencepiece, all needed to calculate embbedings.
Make sure to install compatible versions. At the time of writing, a compatible mix of packages is tf v1.13.1,
hub v0.5.0 and sentencepiece v0.1.82.1.

Remember to download all three .txt files containing quotes and authors. I recomend to run the code in notebook mode (Jupyter for example) to understand the output in each step.
Happy coding and thanks for using my code!
