This Python 3 notebook includes all functions and modules requried to run the quote embedding algorithm. 
Use it for your own projects at will. 

Tensorflow , tf-hub and tf-sentencepiece, all needed to calculate embbedings.
Make sure to install compatible versions. At the time of this writing, a compatible mix of packages is tf #v1.13.1,
hub v0.5.0 and sentencepiece v0.1.82.1.

Remember to download all three .txrt files containing quotes and authors. I recomend to run the code in notebook node to
understand the output in each step.
